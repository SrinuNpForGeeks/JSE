			MultiThreading :-
			**************
MultiTasking :- 
************
=> Executing multiple task simultaneously can be called as MultiTasking.

MultiTasking can be achieved in two ways.
	
	1.Process Based Multi tasking (Multi Processing).
	2.Thread Based Multi tasking (Multi Threading).

	
Process Based Multi tasking :-
***************************

=> Process is a heavy weight.
=> Process can not shares the memory.
=> Cost of communication between the processes would be very high.
=> Context switching between the processes will take more time.

That is the reason we will go with Thread based multi tasking.

Thread Based Multi tasking (Multi Threading) :-
***************************

=>Thread is a small unit of a process.
=>Thread is a light weight object.
=>Thread shares the memory.
=>Cost of communication between the processes would be very low.
=>Context switching between the processes will take less time.

=>In Generally the Threads execution will be taken care by JVM.
=>In JDK we have the concept called as ThreadScheduler. Which is going to schedule the threads.

refer multithreading diagram .

Thread life cycle :-
*****************

The Thread life cycle is divided into 4 states.

1. New State

2. Runnable or Running State

3. Non Runnable State

4. Termination State.

refer ThreadLifeCycle diagram.


Creating Thread : -
***************

=> We can create Thread in two ways 

	1. By using "java.lang.Thread" class.
	2. By using " java.lang.Runnable" interface.
	3. By using " java.lang.Callable" interface
java.lang.Thread class :-
***********************
=> java.lang.Thread is an abstract class which is internally implements " java.lang.Runnable" interface.

=> java.lang.Thread class has given methods which are used to start() the thread and to do other operations on thread.

Constructors :-
************

public Thread()

public Thread(Runnable rs) :- this constructor can be used whenever we develop a thread using "java.lang.Runnable" interface.


The "java.lang.Thread" class having  an abstract method as "public void run()"  within this method we will implement actual thread implementation logic.

=>This run() method will automatically called by the JVM once the Thread Schedular schedules the thread.


"java.lang.Runnable" interface :-
******************************
=> " java.lang.Runnable" interface has abstract method as "public abstract void run() ".

=>  If we develop a class by implementing "Runnable" interface  then our class instance can be act as a thread by default.

=>  To make our class instance as a thread then we need pass this object as a parameter to the "java.lang.Thread" constructor.


public class Sample implements Runnable
	{
public void run()
	{
....
....
	}
	}

AppCode :-
**********

Runnable r = new Sample();
Thread t = new Thead(r);
t.start();


Sleep method in java
**********************

The sleep() method of Thread class is used to sleep a thread for the specified amount of time.

Syntax of sleep() method in java

The Thread class provides two methods for sleeping a thread:

public static void sleep(long miliseconds)throws InterruptedException
public static void sleep(long miliseconds, int nanos)throws InterruptedException

=> The "java.lang.Thread" class has the following method to get the name of the Thread :-

public static Thread currentThread() :- Which will returns curretly running thread object.

public String getName() :-  It returns the Thread name.

public void setName(String) :- This is used to set the name to the Thread.
