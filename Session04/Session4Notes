Understanding looping statments :-
*******************************
1. while loop 
2. do while loop
3. for loop

Understanding while loop :-
************************
while loop will be executed till the condition is failed.

Syntax :-

	while(Condition)
	{
	.....
	......
	increment/decrement. (or) any condition fail logic
	}

PrintNumbers from 10 to 1 : refer PrintNumbersEx2.java

Understanding "/" and "%" operators 

"/" operator  will allways gives Quaficient as a result.
************
12/2  then the output is 6.

123/10  then the output is  12.

123/2 then the out put is  61.

"%" operator  will allways gives Reminder as a result.
************
12%2  then the output is 0.

123%10  then the output is  3.

123%2 then the out put is  1.

63%4 then out put is 3.




for loop :
******* 

Same as while loop but initialization and condition checking and condition break logic can be written at same place.

syntax :  for( Initialization ; conditiion checking ; condition breaking)

	In a for loop, Initialization logic executes only once.


Note : Initialization and condition breaking statments in a for loop are optional but the conditiion checking  is mandatory.
