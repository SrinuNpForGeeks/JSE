			enum :-
***

=> enum is a special data type, can be used to define constants or static content.
=> Whatever data members you declare in enum are by default "public static final" varibles.
=> As all the data members are static final variables, it's good practice to declare all the data members in capital letters.
=> enum can be declared within the class or outside the class.
=> enum invokes the constructor for every data member to initialize the value.
=> If we don't pass any value to the enum data member then the default value would be the data member name itself.

  enum Color 
    { 
        RED, GREEN, BLUE; 
    } 

public class Test 
{ 
    
    // Driver method 
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        Color c1 = Color.RED; 
        System.out.println(c1); 
    } 
}


	
=>Every enum internally implemented by using Class.

/* internally above enum Color is converted to
class Color
{
     public static final Color RED = new Color();
     public static final Color BLUE = new Color();
     public static final Color GREEN = new Color();
}*/

Enum and Inheritance :

All enums implicitly extend java.lang.Enum class.
As a class can only extend one parent in Java, so an enum cannot extend anything else.
toString() method is overridden in java.lang.Enum class,which returns enum constant name.

enum can implement many interfaces.
values(), ordinal() and valueOf() methods :

These methods are present inside java.lang.Enum.

values() method can be used to return all values present inside enum.

Order is important in enums.By using ordinal() method, each enum constant index can be found, just like array index.

valueOf() method returns the enum constant of the specified string value, if exists.


=> enum with constomized value :
   **************************

By default enums have their own string values, we can also assign some custom values to enums. Consider below example for that.

Examples:

enum  Fruits
{
    APPLE(ìREDî), BANANA(ìYELLOWî), GRAPES(ìGREENî);
}
In above example we can see that the Fruits enum have three members i.e APPLE, BANANA and GRAPES with have their own different custom values RED, YELLOW and GREEN respectively.

Procedure :-

1. We have to create parameterized constructor for this enum class.
 	 Why? Because as we know that enum classís object canít be create explicitly so for initializing   we use parameterized constructor. 

And the constructor cannot be the public or protected it must have private or default modifiers. 
	Why? if we create public or protected, it will allow initializing more than one objects. This is totally against enum concept.

2.We have to create one getter method to get the value of enums.

enum TrafficSignal 
{ 
    // This will call enum constructor with one 
    // String argument 
    RED("STOP"), GREEN("GO"), ORANGE("SLOW DOWN"); 
  
    // declaring private variable for getting values 
    private String action; 
  
    // getter method 
    public String getAction() 
    { 
        return this.action; 
    } 
  
    // enum constructor - cannot be public or protected 
    private TrafficSignal(String action) 
    { 
        this.action = action; 
    } 
} 

testcode :-
********
	TrafficSignal[] signals = TrafficSignal.values();
	for(int i = 0 ; i < signals.length ; i++)
	{
		System.out.println(singnals[i].getAction());
	}

JVM Architecture ::

Please refer below link 

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/jvm-works-jvm-architecture/



				Inner Classes :-
				*************

=> Defining the class inside the class can be called as Inner Class.

Adv :-
***
	=> Inner Classes groups all the related classes togather.
	=> Optimises the code.
	=> Increases the readability of the program.

Inner Classes are of Three types.

	1. Nested Classes or Non Static Inner classes

			a. Member Class or Inner Class
			b. Annonymous Inner Class
			c. Local Inner Class.

	2. Static Inner Classes

	3. Nestead Interfaces.
			

Member Class or Inner Class :-
***************************

=> Defining a class inside the class can be called as Member Class or Inner class.
=> An Inner class can able to access the private members of a Outer class.
=> To create the Inner class Object we need Outer class reference.

refer MemberClassEx 

Annonymous Inner Class :-
**********************
=> An Inner class which does not contains a name can called Annonymous Inner Class.
=> Annonymous Inner Classes can be implemented using interface or abstract classes.

=> For an Annonymous Inner class name will be decided by the JVM at compile time.
=> JVM makes the annonymous inner class as a sub class of interface or abstract class.
=> At run time JVM creates the object of annonymous inner class then that will be refered by super class referce.


refer AnnonymousInnerClassEx


Local Inner Class :-
******************
=> An Inner class which is defined within the method can be called as Local Inner class.
=> The Local Inner class can not be accessible outside the method.
=> The Local Inner classes increases the functionality of a method.

refer LocalInnerClassEx


 Static Inner Class :-
********************

=> A Static class defined within the class can be called as Static Inner Class.
=> We can directly access Static Inner class with the help of Outer class name.
=> The static inner class can access only the static methods of a Outer class.

refer StaticInnerClassEx


Nestead Interfaces :-
******************
=> Defining an interface within the interface can be called as Nestead Interface.
=> We can access inner interface with the help of Outer interface name.
=> Using Nestead Interfaces we can implement specific methods.

refer NesteadInterfacesEx

Note :-
*****
Nestead Interfaces can also be implemented through classes.
