Understanding Object Oriented Princeples :-
****************************************
class : -
******
	"class" is a user defined data type.
	"class" is a collection of a data members and methods.
	"class" is a logic view.
	
Syntax :-
	class <Class_Name>
	{
	Data_Members;
	Methods;
	}

class HumanBeing
	{
int humanMind = 1;
int humanHands = 2;

public void charecter(humanMind)
{
...
...
}
	}

=> We can not feel the class without an object.


Understanding Object :-
********************
	=> Object is a physical representation of a class.
	=> One class can have any number of Object's.
	=> Every Object contains its own state, its identity, its own behaviour.
	=> The State of an object represents data members of a class.
	=> The behaviour of an object represents methods of a class.

Object Creation syntax :-
**********************
	We should use "new" keyword to create the Object.

	new <Class_Name>();

	new HumanBeing(); //Here the HumanBeing object is created but which is not referred by any reference.

HumanBeing srinu = new HumanBeing();

Here "srinu" is a reference which is referring to HumanBeing Object.


** In order to access the variable and methods of a class we should create the object.
** We can access the variables and methods of a class using Object reference.


Ex :-
****

class HumanBeing
	{

String qly = "B.Tech";

public void designation()
{
System.out.println(" Designation is : S/W Eng");
}

public static void main(String args[])
{
HumanBeing srinu = new HumaBeing();

System.out.println(" Qualificatio : "+srinu.qly);

srinu.designation();
}

	}
