Method Overloading :-
******************

Method OVerloading is a concept of defining same method within the java class by changing the number of parameters or type of parameters.

Ex :-

class Message
	{
public void display()
{
System.out.println(" From Message : display Demo on Method Overloading ");
}


public void display(int count)
{
System.out.println(" Count :  "+count);
}

public void display(String msg)
{
System.out.println(" msg :  "+msg);
}
	}


public class MethodOverloadingEx
	{
public static void main(String args[])
{
Message obj = new Message();
obj.display();
obj.display(10);
obj.display("Hi Good Morning");
}
	}

Advantage :-
********
Which increases the readability of the java programe.

**************************************

Method Overriding :-
******************
Method Overriding is a concept of redefining the parent class method within the child class.


Rules for method Overrinding :-
****************************
=> You can say the method is overriden when the child class has define the       same method signature.
   Method Signature involves acces specifier , return type , method name and parameters.

=> The child class Overriding method should not have weaker access specifier compare to Parent class method.


Ex :-
****
class Vechile
	{
protected void run()
{
System.out.println("\n Vechile is Running ");
}
	}


class Bus extends Vechile
	{

public void run()
{
System.out.println("\n Bus is Running ");
}

	}

=> MethodOverriding can not be possible by changing the return type.



Polymorphism :-
*************
Single Parent class reference can able to refer any number of Child class Object's that is called polymorphism.

Rule :-
*****
	**Whenever the Parent reference is pointing to the child object's, the parent reference can refer only the methods which are declared in parent class.
	**Using Parent reference we can not call child call specific methods.

refer : PolymorphismEx.java


There are two types of Polymorphism's

	1. Compile-time Polymorphism.
	2. Runtime Polymorphism.


Compile-time Polymorphism :-
**************************
Here calling to Overloaded method can be decided at compile time so it is called Compile-time Polymorphism.


Ex :-
*****
class  Vechile
	{

public void run() 
{
	System.out.println(" Vechile is Running ");
}

public void run(int hp)
{
	System.out.println(" Vechile runs with HP = "+hp);
}
	}

class  Bike extends Vechile
	{
	public Bike()
		{
	System.out.println(" \n\n From Bike Cosntructor");
		}
	}

public class CompileTimePolymorphismEx
	{
public static void main(String args[])
{
	Vechile c = new Bike();
	c.run();
	c.run(150); // Calling to these overloaded methods is deciding at 			compile time.
}
	}


Runtime Polymorphism :-
**************************
Here calling to the Overridden method can be decided at run time so it is called Runtime Polymorphism.

Ex :
****
class  Vechile
	{


public void run() 
{
	System.out.println(" Vechile is Running ");
}

	}


class  Bike extends Vechile
	{
	
	public void run() 
		{
	System.out.println(" Bike is Running ");
		}

	}



public class RunTimePolymorphismEx
	{
public static void main(String args[])
{
	Vechile c = new Bike();
	c.run(); // Here the calling to overriden method is decided at runtime
		 
}	

	} 




final keyword concept :-
*********************

final is a keyword which can be applied to a

	=> Variable
		OR
	=> Method 
		OR
	=> Class


final Variable :-
**************
=> If we declare a variable as final which can not be modified.
=> For the final variables default values won't be assigned by the JVM.
=> final variables must be initialized before using.

Blank final variable :-
********************
** We can initialise the final variable within the constructor which is called blank final variable.

Blank Final Variables can be used for the implementation of PANCard application.

Note:-
****
** If it is a static final variable , we can initialise them in static block.


final method :-
*************
=> If we declare a method as final which can not be overridden.


final class :-
************
	If we declare a class as "final" , which can not be inherited.

Sample.java
***********
final class Sample
	{
public void getInfo()
{
System.out.println("\n\n Information about the Sample Class :");
}
	}

class Child extends Sample
	{
	}


Once we compile this we get the following error : -

Sample.java:9: error: cannot inherit from final Sample
class Child extends Sample
