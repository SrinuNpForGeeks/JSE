Understanding Local Variables and Instance Variables :-
******************************************************

Instance Variables :-
********************
=> The Variables which are declared within the class can be called as instance variables.
=> JVM will assigns defaults values to the instance variables at the time of Object creation.
=> All instance variable can be accessible within the class directly.
=> If we want to access instance variables outside the class , we need object reference.

Ex :-
class Sample
	{
int accNo ;
String accName;
float amount;
boolean status; //Instance Variables.
....
....
....
	}

Local Variables :-
***************
=> The Variable which declare within the method can be called as Local Variables.
=> For the Local variables defaults values can not be assigned by the JVM.
=> All the Local variables should be initialised before using.
=> The Local Variables can be accessible only within the method.

class Sample 
	{
....
....
public void display()
{
int pinCode = 10; // Local Variable

System.out.println(" pinCode : "+pinCode);
}
	}

Recursion in Java :

Recursion in java is a process in which a method calls itself continuously. 
A method in java that calls itself is called recursive method.
It makes the code compact but complex to understand.

In a Recursive program Base condition is mandatory.
